- A first part aggregating all the cards whether they are maindeck or sideboard and whatever the archetypes.\n
- The second part is stratified by archetype and shows the presence and winrate of new cards when they are present in the main deck. \n
- The third part is stratified by archetype and shows the presence and winrate of new cards when they are present in the sideboard.\n

For parts 2 and 3, the win rates of the cards are only described in situations with a number of wins and losses (excluding 5-0 leagues), but the presence of a card also includes 5-0 leagues.
