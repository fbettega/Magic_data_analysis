# Modern_data_analysis
Personal verion of magic metagame analysis

Result are avaible [here](https://mtg-modern.serveur-du-placard.xyz/)  


## Dependencies
**Warning**: I've tried to make this script as reproducible as possible, but as it wasn't my initial intention, some of the details may be missing.  I may have forgotten some packages or folders that are necessary for the script to work properly.  


### Github repo and script
The initial json is obtained from the [badaro parser](https://github.com/Badaro/MTGOArchetypeParser).   


Normally the pull of the necessary github repo is automatic (to clone the repos concerned, simply uncomment the git clone lines in the  [S0_one_file_to_rule_them_all.R file](./S0_one_file_to_rule_them_all.R) ).

**Currently the automatic github pull does not work because to obtain results similar to mine it is necessary to merge in Archetype parser the decklist cach repo of [Badaro](https://github.com/Badaro/MTGODecklistCache) and [Jiliac](https://github.com/Jiliac/MTGODecklistCache/).**
Format data pull is automatic but can also be found [here](https://github.com/Badaro/MTGOFormatData) 

To get scryfall data in csv i use my own script you can find it [here](https://github.com/fbettega/fetch_scryfall_data_to_csv) file generated should be put in  'Modern_data_analysis\data\mtg_data'.   

### Packages

Install packages script can be found [here](../sources/S3_install_packages.R)  

List of package below :  


```{r}
list.of.packages <- readr::read_rds("../data/list_of_packages.rds")
list.of.packages %>%
  select(package) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "pipe")
```


## format includes
Table below list format includes and starting date
```{r format_table_print, results='asis'}
format_date_en_cours_fulltable <- read.csv("../other_file/format_handle.csv")
format_date_en_cours_fulltable %>% 
  rename(
    Format = format_param,
    `Start date` = date_cutoff) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "pipe")
```
